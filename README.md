PLAY'MONEY

MY idea is to make an app where you get to play in the stockmarket, risk free, User sets up an account, signup/login(this will be generated into a database) how much they want to start playing with 0-1Million dollars, They will have access to stock ticker information(ill pull this from an api, found yahoo finance? maybe a different one? not sure yet on that api) user can buy stocks at real time prices, and sell at real time prices, pretend to be a long term invester or try there hand at day trading, if i can id also like to add in the options(calls, puts) and futures market. 
if someone is new to invester Id like to have a page that shows hot stocks(another api most likely) or can pull up company info or the latest financials, or latest analysts call(other api)

models ill need for database....
user-login, password
account-start money, equities held, 

signup/signin page
home page select how much you want to play with page and how to use the site

start searching stocks 
individual stocks page 

Hot Stocks page-maybe track insider trading or top trending stock...(wallstreet bets)
your portfolio page - show stock - amount - and percentage you've gained or lost - maybe a graph or chart to show your total portfolio, and your total amount in real time.

apis 
yahoo finance?
wallstreet bets
